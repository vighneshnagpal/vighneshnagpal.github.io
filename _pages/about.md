I'm Vighnesh, a PhD student and NSF Graduate Fellow in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. My research interests are still-evolving, but broadly centre around the study of exoplanets from various perspectives. 

I obtained my undergraduate degree in Physics & Astrophysics from the University of California, Berkeley in December 2023. At Berkeley, I had a ton of fun exploring research on topics such as exoplanet science, radio astronomy, and galactic dynamics. 

Outside research, my university experience was immeasurably enriched by the community at Berkeley's <a href="https://ihouse.berkeley.edu/">International House</a>, a place I was fortunate to call home throughout my stay in Berkeley.  


Along the way, I was exceptionally fortunate to work with some exceptional mentors including (but not limited) to Sarah Blunt, Josh Dillon, Brendan Bowler, Konstantin Batygin, Aaron Parsons, Max Goldberg, and Soumavo Ghosh. Before starting my PhD in the sunny paradise of Chicago, I continued some of this undergraduate research in a semester-long postbacc as a Junior Specialist in the Berkeley Radio Astronomy Laboratory. 

Outside astronomy, I love songwriting and learning about music production. I greatly enjoy photography and occasionally binge-watch fluffy K-Dramas to feel good about life once again. And I am always down to play racket sports and volleyball.
