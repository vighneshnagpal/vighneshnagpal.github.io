Howdy! I'm Vighnesh, a PhD student in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. My research interests are broad and still-evolving, but I have been developing quite the soft spot for exoplanets. 

I obtained my undergraduate degrees in Physics & Astrophysics from the University of California, Berkeley in December 2023. Over the course of my time in college, I had the good fortune to work closely with some exceptional mentors including (but not limited) to Sarah Blunt, Josh Dillon, Brendan Bowler, Konstantin Batygin, Aaron Parsons, Max Goldberg, and Soumavo Ghosh. Before starting my PhD in the sunny paradise of Chicago, I had the pleasure of continuing my undergraduate research work as a Junior Specialist in the Berkeley Radio Astronomy Laboratory. 

Interests outside astronomy: 
- Racquet Sports
- Watching Fluffy K-Dramas
- Music Production & song-writing 
- Photography
