Howdy! I'm Vighnesh, a PhD student in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. My research interests are broad and still-evolving, but I have been developing a particular fondness for the study of exoplanets and their astounding diversity. 

I obtained my undergraduate degree in Physics & Astrophysics from the University of California, Berkeley in December 2023. Over my time in college, I had a ton of fun diving head-first into research on topics such as exoplanet science and radio astronomy. Along the way, I was exceptionally fortunate to work with some exceptional mentors including (but not limited) to Sarah Blunt, Josh Dillon, Brendan Bowler, Konstantin Batygin, Aaron Parsons, Max Goldberg, and Soumavo Ghosh. Before starting my PhD in the sunny paradise of Chicago, I continued some of this undergraduate research work as a Junior Specialist in the Berkeley Radio Astronomy Laboratory. 

Interests outside astronomy: 
- Racquet Sports
- Watching Fluffy K-Dramas
- Music Production & song-writing 
- Photography
