I'm Vighnesh, a PhD student and NSF Graduate Fellow in the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. Here, I am working with Professor Diana Powell on the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes. More broadly, my research interests centre around the study of exoplanets from various perspectives. 

I obtained my undergraduate degree in Physics & Astrophysics from the University of California, Berkeley in December 2023. During my time in college, I had a ton of fun exploring research on topics across exoplanet science, radio transients, and galactic dynamics. Before starting my PhD in the sunny paradise of Chicago, I continued some of this undergraduate research as a Junior Specialist in the Berkeley Radio Astronomy Laboratory.

Outside research, my university experience was immeasurably enriched by the community at <a href="https://ihouse.berkeley.edu/">International House</a>, a place I was lucky to call home throughout my stay in Berkeley.  

Along the way, I have been exceptionally fortunate to work with some exceptional mentors including (but not limited) to  <a href="https://sites.google.com/g.harvard.edu/sarah/home">Sarah Blunt</a>, <a href="https://joshdillon.com/">Josh Dillon</a>, <a href="https://www.as.utexas.edu/~bpbowler/">Brendan Bowler</a>, <a href="https://www.konstantinbatygin.com/">Konstantin Batygin</a>, <a href="https://astro.berkeley.edu/people/aaron-parsons/">Aaron Parsons</a>, <a href="https://maxgoldberg.me/">Max Goldberg</a>, and <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/drsoumavoghosh/home?authuser=0"> Soumavo Ghosh </a>.  

Outside astronomy, I love producing music, photography, and engaging my dangerous tendency to binge-watch fluffy K-Dramas and anime. I am also always down to play racket sports or for a game of volleyball.
