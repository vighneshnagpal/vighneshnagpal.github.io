Howdy! I'm Vighnesh, a PhD student in Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. My research interests are broad and still-evolving, but I have quite the soft spot for exoplanets. 

I obtained my undergraduate degrees in Physics & Astrophysics from the University of California, Berkeley in December 2023. Before starting my PhD in the sunny paradise of Chicago, I had the pleasure of continuing my undergraduate research work as a Junior Specialist in the Berkeley Radio Astronomy Laboratory.
