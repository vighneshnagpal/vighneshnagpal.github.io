I am currently working on developing new models for exoplanet atmospheres using microphysics with Professor Diana Powell at UChicago. Concurrently, I am collaborating with Jakob Robnik & Professor Uros Seljak at UC Berkeley to conduct a new hierarchical analysis of data from the Kepler Telescope in order to constrain demographics below the noise level.
